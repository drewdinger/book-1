# Execution

We made the login feature work across pages and completed the feature that allows people to change their location when logged in

We also added the list of logged-in users to the map on the admin page

Finally, we generated a list of potential drivers or passengers for a user to see after they submit the form to sign up as a passenger or driver

We did not create a way to select a driver, and thus did not create a way to notify drivers that they were selected
